# Tunnel interior review

## Tunnel interior reference pass — 2026-10-19

Expanded interior from 11 to 17 receding heart ribs, ratio .80, enlarged first
rib to .98 of opening scale. Added layered pink neon cores/halos, deterministic
stars clipped to the heart outline, and sprite glow accents toward the lower
vanishing point. Existing opening silhouette and surrounding source art unchanged.
This is a decorative 2.5D approximation; full reference bloom, clouds and reflected
water are still unfinished. No new navigation, external asset or dependency.

Branch production/homepage-rebuild. Changed js/exterior-assembly.js plus cache
versions in js/graybox-ship.js, script.js and index.html. Source GLBs/Blender files
untouched; Blender not launched. Syntax and diff checks pass. Browser screenshots
reviewed at 390×844 and 1440×900; boarding to dashboard and Home/focus restoration
passed. No captured console warnings/errors. Screenshots in production/renders/
terrain-variation-v001/tunnel-{mobile,desktop}.png. Physical Safari and performance
profiling not tested. Next: review tunnel proportions/glow before water polish.

## Straight tunnel / aperture correction — 2026-10-19

Supersedes downward convergence in the earlier tunnel pass. Retraced the heart
aperture against portal-v002-cutout.png; black backing slightly overlaps under
the inner chrome rim. Ribs now shrink about one constant center (portal-local
X .01 × portal size, Y -.10 × portal size) rather than descending with distance.
Stars and glow use the same revised aperture coordinates. Decorative 2.5D tunnel
remains an approximation, not traversable geometry. Original assets unchanged.

Changed exterior-assembly.js and module cache versions in graybox-ship.js,
script.js and index.html, branch production/homepage-rebuild. Module syntax and
diff checks passed. Mobile 390×844 and desktop 1440×900 reviewed: no visible sky
gaps at the inner rim, centered straight-back convergence. Proof screenshots:
production/renders/terrain-variation-v001/tunnel-straight-{mobile,desktop}.png.
No Blender launch or deployment. Next: user review of corrected tunnel shape.

## Actual depth corridor and traced aperture — 2026-10-19

Supersedes the hand-fit generic heart and coplanar shrinking outlines. Traced
the connected transparent aperture of the existing 1254×1254 portal cutout
(alpha<96, 318213 pixels, bounds X262–991/Y446–1096), simplified to 58 outline
vertices with 1.5px tolerance. New js/portal-aperture.js records the normalized
outline. A black seam overlaps beneath the chrome rim; original PNG unchanged.

exterior-assembly.js now builds connected dark corridor walls, end cap, floor,
edge/grid guides and 34 equal-size arches at increasing Z positions (60 units
depth). Perspective supplies recession. Per-frame view alignment shears the
corridor axis through the aperture center without moving its front cross-section;
this is a camera-aligned visual tunnel, not a traversal/navigation implementation.
Floor and light appearance remain stylized, not reference-quality reflections.
There is still a pointed heart threshold in the source artwork.

Changed graybox-ship.js to update the tunnel view; cache versions in that file,
script.js and index.html. Branch production/homepage-rebuild. Syntax/diff checks
pass. Fresh browser tab used after original tab connection timed out; 390×844
and 1440×900 reviewed with no visible sky seam. Boarding and Home/focus restore
passed, no captured warnings/errors. Screenshots production/renders/terrain-
variation-v001/tunnel-depth-{mobile,desktop}.png. No original GLB/Blender edit,
Blender launch, dependency install or deployment. Added runtime geometry requires
a later mobile GPU budget check; physical Safari not tested. Next: user review
of corridor depth, then floor/water and light polish.
